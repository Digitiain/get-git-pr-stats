# Get GitHub pull request (PR) stats

This repository is for a simple script to get statistics about pull requests for a given GitHub repo. 

In the first instance, it's just to find out how many PRs have been merged in the last 2 weeks, but the plan is to make it more user-configurable. 

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.5.2

## Use

I would recommend setting up a virtual environment before installing the prerequisites. I'll be more explicit as I update this README.
